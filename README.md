# roster

This repository serves as a programming project to assess your understanding of certain Python concepts and give you an opportunity to demonstrate your Python proficiency by crafting a solution class and sharing your design decisions.

## the problem

Mrs. Jones, a teacher at Billings Elementary School, has been asked by the administration to track her students' grades in a roster stored in an Excel file. Unfortunatly, Mrs. Jones had a bad experience with Excel as a child and as solemnly sworn never to use Excel again. Your task is to create a Python class for reading and manipulating a provided Excel file so Mrs. Jones doesn't haven't to use Excel to successfully record her students' grades.

## grading

You will be graded on:
- the architecture and elegance of your code
- the cleanliness and documentation of your code
- the number of unit tests that you pass

It is not necessarily expected that you will be able to construct a solution that can pass all the unittests, so focus more on quality if you feel you will have a hard time completing the project.
